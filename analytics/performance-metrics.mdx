- Naturalness score
- Understanding accuracy
- Response appropriateness
- Overall quality rating

**Goal Achievement**
- Success rate
- Goal completion
- Outcome quality
- Effectiveness score

- Average call duration
- Calls per hour
- Time to resolution
- Resource utilization

### Performance Dashboard

- Individual agent scores
- Comparative analysis
- Trend tracking
- Improvement recommendations

## Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Tracking

### CSAT Collection

**Post-Call Surveys**
- Automated surveys
- Quick rating (1-5 stars)
- Optional feedback
- High response rates

- Reduce follow-up needs
- Increase FCR rate

## Transfer Rate to Human Agents

### Transfer Metrics

**Transfer Rate**
- Percentage of calls transferred
- Transfer reasons
