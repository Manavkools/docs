## How Tabbly AI Voice Agents Works?

Tabbly uses a modular pipeline architecture where each component plays a specific role in creating seamless voice conversations. Here's how the pieces work together:

### 1. Input Channels

The entry point for user interactions with your voice agent:

- **Voice Calls**: Inbound and outbound phone conversations
- **Web Integration**: Voice interactions embedded on your website
- **Mobile Apps**: Voice capabilities within your mobile applications
- **Messaging Platforms**: Voice messages through chat applications

### 2. Speech Recognition (ASR)

Our advanced speech recognition technology converts spoken words into text that the AI can process and understand:

- **Multi-language Support**: Recognition across 30+ languages
- **Accent Adaptation**: Understands diverse accents and speaking styles
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant transcription for fluid conversations
- **Noise Handling**: Effective recognition even in challenging audio environments

### 3. AI Brain (LLM)

The intelligence layer that understands context, intent, and generates appropriate responses:

- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history and understands references
- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies what the caller wants to accomplish
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes complex queries and requests
- **Decision Making**: Determines appropriate actions based on conversation flow
- **Knowledge Integration**: Accesses your business data and documentation

### 4. Voice Synthesis (TTS)

Converts the AI's text responses into natural, human-like speech:

- **Natural Voices**: Choose from a library of realistic voice profiles
- **Emotion & Tone**: Voices that convey appropriate emotion and personality
- **Multiple Languages**: Native-sounding voices across supported languages
- **Custom Voice Cloning**: Create unique branded voices (Enterprise feature)
- **Pronunciation Control**: Fine-tune how specific terms are spoken

### 5. Output Delivery

Returns the agent's response to the user through their chosen channel:

- **Voice Output**: Natural spoken responses during calls
- **Call Transcripts**: Written records of conversations
