## Crafting Effective Prompts

Writing clear, well-structured prompts is crucial for your voice agent's success. Follow these guidelines to create agents that understand and respond accurately.

### Core Prompting Principles

**Be Clear and Specific**

- Define exactly what your agent should accomplish
- Use simple, direct language in your instructions
- Avoid ambiguous terms or vague objectives
- Start with a concise prompt and add details iteratively

**Set Conversation Boundaries**

- Specify the agent's role clearly (e.g., "You are a customer support representative")
- Define what topics the agent should and shouldn't discuss
- Set expectations for conversation length and depth
- Example: "Keep responses under 2 sentences unless asked for more detail"

**Provide Context**

- Include relevant background about your business
- Explain industry-specific terminology
- Define your brand voice and tone
- Share common customer scenarios

### Prompt Structure Template

```
Role: You are a [specific role] for [company name]

Objective: Your goal is to [clear objective]

Constraints:
- Keep responses concise and under [X] sentences
- Always [required behavior]
- Never [prohibited behavior]

Key Information:
[Relevant business details, policies, or data]

Conversation Flow:
1. [Opening approach]
2. [Main interaction guidelines]
3. [Closing procedure]
```

## Critical Voice-Specific Considerations

### Numbers and Formatting

**Always Write Numbers as Words**

- Wrong: "Your order number is 12345"
- Correct: "Your order number is one two three four five"
- Wrong: "The total is \$91.50"
- Correct: "The total is ninety-one dollars and fifty cents"

**Why this matters**: Text-to-speech engines pronounce written numbers more naturally when spelled out, preventing confusion like "ninety-one" being heard as "nine one" or vice versa.

**Special Number Cases**:

- Phone numbers: "nine one four, two three five, six seven eight nine"
- Prices: "twenty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents"
- Dates: "March fifteenth, twenty twenty-five"
- Times: "three thirty PM" or "fifteen hundred hours"
- Percentages: "fifteen percent" not "15%"

### Multi-Language and Script Considerations

**For Hinglish (Hindi-English Mix)**

- Write Hindi words in Devanagari script: "आपका नाम क्या है?"
- Don't use romanized Hindi in prompts: Avoid "aapka naam kya hai"
- Mix naturally: "Hello, आपकी मदद के लिए मैं यहाँ हूं"
- Ensure your TTS voice supports Devanagari rendering

**For Other Mixed Languages**

- Arabic: Use Arabic script (العربية) not transliteration
- Chinese: Use appropriate characters (中文) not pinyin
- Korean: Use Hangul (한국어) not romanization
- Japanese: Use proper mix of Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji

**Script Consistency Rules**:

- Keep each language in its native script throughout
- Don't switch scripts mid-sentence for the same language
- Test pronunciation with your chosen TTS voice
- Provide pronunciation guides for brand names or unique terms

### Pronunciation and Clarity

**Spell Out Acronyms Intentionally**

- If you want it pronounced as letters: "F A Q" or "U S A"
- If it's a word: "FAQ" (pronounced "fak") or "NASA"
- For clarity, add pronunciation hints: "FAQ (F-A-Q)" in your knowledge base

**Technical Terms and Brand Names**

- Add phonetic spellings for difficult words
- Example: "Tabbly (TAB-lee)" in your training data
- Create a pronunciation dictionary for industry jargon
- Test how TTS handles technical vocabulary

**Punctuation Affects Speech**

- Commas create brief pauses
- Periods create longer pauses
- Question marks raise intonation at the end
- Exclamation marks add emphasis (use sparingly)
- Use ellipses (...) for thoughtful pauses

## Conversation Design Best Practices

### Keep It Natural

**Avoid Robotic Patterns**

- "Let me connect you with our billing team"

**Use Conversational Fillers Sparingly**

- Occasional: "Hmm, let me check that for you"
- Don't overuse: "Um," "uh," "like" in every response

**Handle Interruptions Gracefully**

- Program responses for when users cut in
- Example: "Oh, sorry—go ahead" or "Yes, I'm listening"

### Context and Memory

**Reference Previous Statements**

- "As you mentioned earlier about..."
- "Based on what you told me..."
- This shows the agent is truly listening

**Maintain Conversation State**

- Track what information has been collected
- Don't ask for the same details twice
- Build on previous answers logically

### Error Handling and Fallbacks

**When the Agent Doesn't Understand**

- ✅ "I didn't quite catch that. Could you rephrase?"
- ✅ "Just to clarify, are you asking about [interpretation]?"

**Escalation Pathways**

- Define clear triggers for human handoff
- Example: "If user says 'speak to a person' more than once, transfer immediately"
- Set frustration detection: "I can tell this is urgent. Let me connect you with someone who can help right away"

## Prompt Testing and Refinement

### Iterative Improvement Process

**1. Start Simple**

- Begin with a basic prompt covering core functionality
- Test thoroughly in the playground
- Identify gaps and confusion points

**2. Add Complexity Gradually**

- Layer in additional instructions one at a time
- Test after each addition
- Remove anything that doesn't improve performance

**3. Test Edge Cases**

- Unusual requests
- Ambiguous phrasing
- Multiple questions at once
- Background noise scenarios
- Various accents and speaking speeds

**4. Monitor Real Conversations**

- Review call transcripts regularly
- Identify common misunderstandings
- Update prompts based on actual user behavior
- Track improvement metrics over time

### Common Pitfall Avoidance

**Don't Overload the Prompt**

- Too many instructions confuse the agent
- Prioritize the most important behaviors
- Use knowledge base for detailed information

**Avoid Contradictory Instructions**

- "Be brief but comprehensive" creates confusion
- Choose one priority: brevity OR detail
- Make trade-offs explicit

**Don't Assume Knowledge**

- Explain context the agent can't infer
- Provide definitions for industry terms
- Include relevant background information
