## How Usage-Based Billing Works

Tabbly uses a flexible usage-based billing model that charges you only for what you use. This ensures you're not paying for unused capacity while giving you the flexibility to scale up or down as needed.

## Billing Components

### Call Minutes
- **Inbound Calls**: Charged per minute from when the call connects until it ends
- **Outbound Calls**: Charged per minute from when the call connects until it ends
- **Minimum Billing**: Calls are billed in 6-second increments
- **Rounded Up**: Partial minutes are rounded up to the nearest 6-second increment

### Example Calculation

If you make a call that lasts 2 minutes and 15 seconds:
- Total duration: 2 minutes 15 seconds
- Billed as: 2 minutes 30 seconds (rounded to nearest 6-second increment)
- Charge: 2.5 minutes × your per-minute rate

## Billing Cycle

- **Billing Period**: Monthly (calendar month)
- **Billing Date**: First day of each month
- **Payment Methods**: Credit card, ACH, wire transfer (Enterprise)
- **Invoicing**: Automatic invoices sent via email

## Usage Tracking

Monitor your usage in real-time through:
- **Dashboard**: Real-time usage metrics
- **Billing Portal**: Detailed usage breakdowns
- **Email Alerts**: Notifications when approaching limits
- **API Access**: Programmatic usage tracking

## Overage Charges

### Starter & Professional Plans
- **Included Minutes**: Based on your plan tier
- **Overage Rate**: Charged at standard per-minute rates
- **Overage Alerts**: Email notifications at 80%, 90%, and 100% of included minutes

### Enterprise Plans
- **Custom Limits**: Negotiated based on your needs
- **Volume Commitments**: Discounted rates for committed volumes
- **Flexible Overage**: Custom overage terms
