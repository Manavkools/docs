## How Volume Discounts Work

### Monthly Commitments
- Commit to a minimum monthly volume
- Receive discounted rates on all minutes
- Pay only for what you use (no penalties for under-usage in first 3 months)
- Overage minutes charged at the same discounted rate

### Annual Commitments
- Commit to an annual volume minimum
- Receive even greater discounts
- Flexible monthly usage (as long as annual minimum is met)
- Best value for predictable, high-volume needs
