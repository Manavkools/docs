**Hinglish Prompt:**

- Hindi words in Devanagari script: "धन्यवाद" "अच्छा" "महीने"
- English words in Latin script: "professional" "qualified" "budget"
- Numbers in words matching language: "दस लाख" or "ten lakh"

## Best Practices for Using These Templates

1. **Start with the Universal Flow**: Use it as your backbone structure

3. **Keep Prompts Focused**: Don't try to handle every scenario in one prompt
4. **Test Iteratively**: Start simple, test, then add complexity
5. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Numbers in words, proper script for languages
6. **Plan for Failures**: Include edge cases and transfer scenarios

## **Testing Tips:**

- Test the English prompt with various English-speaking accents
- Test the Hinglish prompt with speakers who naturally code-switch
- Verify TTS engine properly renders Devanagari script
- Ensure numbers are pronounced clearly in both versions
- Walk through the entire call flow with multiple test scenarios
- Test edge cases like interruptions, background noise, unclear responses
