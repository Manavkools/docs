## Overview

Maintaining high call quality is essential for successful voice AI operations. Tabbly provides comprehensive tools for monitoring and optimizing call quality.

## Latency Metrics and Monitoring

### Understanding Latency

**What is Latency?**
- Time between speech and response
- Measured in milliseconds
- Affects conversation flow
- Impacts user experience

**Types of Latency**
- Network latency
- Processing latency
- Response generation latency
- Total end-to-end latency

### Monitoring Latency

**Real-Time Monitoring**
- Live latency metrics
- Dashboard display
- Alert thresholds
- Historical tracking

**Latency Targets**
- < 500ms: Excellent
- 500-1000ms: Good
- 1000-2000ms: Acceptable
- > 2000ms: Needs improvement
